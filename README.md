Matlab Data Analysis Functions for Lab

Functions that are integral to operations are found [here](https://github.com/Lalichi/Data-Analysis/tree/master/functions) with the analysis methods used for each lab report found in their respective folders. General default settings are found [here](https://github.com/Lalichi/Data-Analysis/tree/master/settings) however currently its pretty barebones.

I hope this allows me to improve my coding skills UwU
