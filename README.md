Matlab Data Analysis Functions for Lab

Functions that are integral to operations are found [here](https://github.com/Lalichi/Data-Analysis/tree/master/functions) with the analysis methods used for each lab report found in their respective folders. Some of my functions are based on functions written by other users and have been included in the folder [Foreign Code](https://github.com/Lalichi/Data-Analysis/tree/master/functions/Foreign%20Code).

I hope this allows me to improve my coding skills UwU
